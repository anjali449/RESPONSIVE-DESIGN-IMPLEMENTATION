Responsive web design is a way of building websites so they automatically adjust and look good on all screen sizes â€” from mobile phones to large desktops.

Features:
Fluid Layouts: Use flexible units like percentages so elements resize with the screen.

Media Queries: Apply different styles based on screen width (like changing font size or layout on smaller screens).

Flexible Images: Images scale within their containers to avoid breaking the layout.

Mobile-First Approach: Design for small screens first, then enhance for larger ones.
